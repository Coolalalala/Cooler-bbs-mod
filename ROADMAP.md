# Roadmap

For BBS mod, there would be three stages: BBS Studio Port, Old Core Adaptation, 
and Missing Features. Here is the breakdown of these stages:

## BBS Studio Port

This is the stage where I port majority of useful features from BBS Studio into a 
Minecraft Fabric mod. Beside that, I'll also add any features that are essential to 
the port (like model blocks, although that's also part of BBS Studio).

Beside that, here is a list to finish:

- [ ] Optimize keyframe editor rendering
- [ ] Clean up the UI
- [ ] 

## Old Core Adaptation

In this stage, I'll implement any missing features from my mods that are core 
experience. Like following:

- [ ] Action system
  - [ ] In-game recording
- [ ] Damage control
- [ ] Emoticons and S&B
- [ ] BB gun?
- [ ] Vanilla integrations
  - [ ] Item holding
  - [ ] Swimming animation

## Missing features

And finally, once the BBS Studio Port and Old Core Features are done, it's time to 
implement any features that are missing for the user base. Anything that is going to 
be used by a lot of people. No niche features.

The list is TBD.

# Release

Once all of these stages are passed, and people are happy with the tools for the most 
part. It's time preparing for the release. For the release, I need to record a tutorial 
series that teaches how to practically use BBS mod to record machinimas by examples.
